					<p>
						Buzzword bingo, also known as bullshit bingo, is a bingo-style game 
						where participants prepare bingo cards with buzzwords and tick them 
						off when they are uttered during an event, such as a meeting or speech. 
						The goal of the game is to tick off a predetermined number of words 
						in a row and then signal bingo to other players.
